        I am currently working as a software engineer at Ennova Srl,
        which was awarded with the prize of Italian Startup of Year 2014.

        I develop web applications, backends, and APIs for mobile applications,
        which are mainly used by telecommunication companies and energy providers,
        such as Telecom Italia, Vodafone, Enel, and Iren Energia.

        While working at Ennova, I have been in charge of integrating clients' databases,
        I developed web services used by clientsâ€™ IVR,
        and I coordinated the efforts of Ennova's developers in order to develop various mobile apps.
        Moreover, I personally developed some of the most critical server side building blocks in many projects,
        and I have helped to design Ennova's cloud computing architecture.

        Before working on web and mobile applications, I obtained a Ph.D in security of computer systems.
        In this context, I have participated in the European research project \otc,
        aimed at creating an open-source framework for Trusted Computing.
        Following this, I worked on security of cloud computing, contributing to the research project TClouds,
        whose goal was to create a resilient and privacy-friendly cloud computing platform.

        While holding my positions, both in university and in industry,
        I have always been involved into the training of students or new employees.

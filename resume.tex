%  \textbf{Ennova Srl, \url{http://www.ennova.it}}\\
\vspace{-1em}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Explored virtually any new technology of the company in the past two years.
  I have pioneered the usage of Clojure, the microservice architecture, and Chef and Docker for DevOps.
  Moreover I have investigated enterprise tools like PEGA PRPC and Veeva.
  \item Together with another senior engineer, I have applied such technologies to redesign the company's main project,
  by splitting it in microservices written in Clojure that communicate using an event bus based on RabbitMQ.
  The system which was once made of a single Java application is now composed by 9 Clojure microservices.
  As a result the application is now easier to maintain and develop.
  \item To better handle the development process of this application, I have contributed to the design of the internal
  continuous integration/continuous deploy workflow. This flow is now completely based on JenkinsCI jobs and requires
  no manual intervention.
  \item Have led the migration from our existing cloud service provider to a new one. Twice.
  For the last migration, I have redesigned development and deployment architecture using Chef.io.
  The resulting system is defined by a common configuration shared among all the environment, including developmen, QA, staging and production.
  \item Personally handled the deployment in production of our largest application, defining the procedures and implementing scripts to automate them.
  Moreover, I am currently taking care of the maintenance of the production servers.
  \item I actively am contributing to our new projects by helping to write the documentation and the proposals,
  and by contributing to the initial design of the technical solution.
  \item Written an internal tool that streamlined the QA operation of the company. The tool is now used by the whole QA team on daily basis.

  \item Managed a team of 5 people for the design and implementation of an utility mobile and web application for an energy provider.
  The application integrates data from 5 different sources, has 6M+ contracts and 30M+ invoices.
  I personally wrote the most critical parts.
  \item Created an API that gets called 220K+ times per day with an average response time of 75 ms.
  \item Contributed to the digitalization of many business process for telephone companies, resulting in a dramatic
  increase of efficiency.
  \item Helped to the redesign of the CRM solution for a major telephone company. We reduced the number of multiple calls by 30\%
  and their duration by aggregating together all the previous tools that the CRM agents used. The CRM is used by 350+ users and handles 3.5K+ tickets per day.
  \item Designed the cloud infrastructure used to provide services to clients. I currently am the reference for IT architecture evolution.
  \item Have managed a team of 6 developers, 1 designer, 1 dev ops and 1 analysts; supervised new employees; taught and enforced good programming practices such as TDD, CI and CD.

I~think paperwork is an unpleasant legacy that belongs to the past and being capable of securely signing documents would greatly benefit many. When I~saw the software engineer position advertised on your website, I~thought that it would be great if I~had the opportunity to join you.

My resume is enclosed for your review. Given my background in computer security and my skills, I~think I~would be an ideal match for this position, and, therefore, I~would appreciate your consideration for this job opening.

\textbf{[REQ] Experience: You’ve done web development for 5+ years with an MVC-type framework.}
I~have used MVC frameworks (mainly Yes it is (Yii), but I~also had some experience with CakePhp and Rails) for about six years. I~started with a small side project while I~was earning my Ph.D, and then, continued when I~joined Ennova. Nowadays, I~currently develop mainly using Yii.

\textbf{[REQ] Team work: You’re used to working collaboratively, participating in code reviews, and being a team player.}
I~have always preferred team work to solo work. I~have worked both in large (for Europe-wide research projects) and tiny (at Ennova and for small research and side projects) teams, and I~have enjoyed pair programming with colleagues. At Ennova, I~have also coordinated people as a team leader.
Given my experience, I~prefer to work in small and lean teams where meetings and conference calls are seldom used.

\textbf{[REQ] Product-centric: You love solving hard technical challenges and producing clean code, but you realize the product and the end-user’s experience is the most important thing. You need to care about the users and think beyond just the technical challenges.}
Like many developers, I~love to write beautiful code. Reading \textit{Clean Code} by Robert Martin changed my mind and strongly pushed me towards TDD. I~like the ability of continually refactoring my code that TDD gives me. I~like when I~read code months after I~wrote it and it is still readable.

Similar to reading clean code, buying my first Mac changed my mind on what an object should look like.
I~believe that, in order to create a great product every single detail should be taken into consideration.
The entire production process must be planned in advance and things should not be expected to just happen by chance along the way.
%is to consider every aspect, actually design it, and not let it just happen by chance.
This is why, whenever I~can, I~prototype UI~with paper or software (usually balsamiq and marvelApp), and I~refine ideas and iterate, if possible, involving other people, especially the intended users.
In this context, I~like the possibility of making continuous updates to the web interface and using A/B testing in order to keep improving the user experience.

\textbf{[REQ] Self-directed: We’re a startup. We need someone who is comfortable taking an imperfect feature specification and driving it all the way to completion.}
I~have strong startup experience, and I~know what it means to work on draft ideas and complete them into a product. I~have experience involving customers into the design process, working in their constrained environments, and adapting to their needs and requirements.

I~hope my profile fits your requirements, sincerely yours,

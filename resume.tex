I~think paperwork is an unpleasant legacy that belongs to the past and being capable of securely signing documents would greatly benefit many. When I~saw the software engineer position advertised on your website, I~thought that it would be great if I~had the opportunity to join you.

My resume is enclosed for your review. Given my background in computer security and my skills, I~think I~would be an ideal match for this position, and, therefore, I~would appreciate your consideration for this job opening.

\textbf{[REQ] Experience: You’ve done web development for 5+ years with an MVC-type framework.}
I~have used MVC frameworks (mainly Yes it is (Yii), but I~also had some experience with CakePhp and Rails) for about six years. I~started with a small side project while I~was earning my Ph.D, and then, continued when I~joined Ennova. Nowadays, I~currently develop mainly using Yii.

\textbf{[REQ] Team work: You’re used to working collaboratively, participating in code reviews, and being a team player.}
I~have always preferred team work to solo work. I~have worked both in large (for Europe-wide research projects) and tiny (at Ennova and for small research and side projects) teams, and I~have enjoyed pair programming with colleagues. At Ennova, I~have also coordinated people as a team leader.
Given my experience, I~prefer to work in small and lean teams where meetings and conference calls are seldom used.

\textbf{[REQ] Product-centric: You love solving hard technical challenges and producing clean code, but you realize the product and the end-user’s experience is the most important thing. You need to care about the users and think beyond just the technical challenges.}
Like many developers, I~love to write beautiful code. Reading \textit{Clean Code} by Robert Martin changed my mind and strongly pushed me towards TDD. I~like the ability of continually refactoring my code that TDD gives me. I~like when I~read code months after I~wrote it and it is still readable.

Similar to reading clean code, buying my first Mac changed my mind on what an object should look like.
I~believe that, in order to create a great product every single detail should be taken into consideration.
The entire production process must be planned in advance and things should not be expected to just happen by chance along the way.
%is to consider every aspect, actually design it, and not let it just happen by chance.
This is why, whenever I~can, I~prototype UI~with paper or software (usually balsamiq and marvelApp), and I~refine ideas and iterate, if possible, involving other people, especially the intended users.
In this context, I~like the possibility of making continuous updates to the web interface and using A/B testing in order to keep improving the user experience.

\textbf{[REQ] Self-directed: We’re a startup. We need someone who is comfortable taking an imperfect feature specification and driving it all the way to completion.}
I~have strong startup experience, and I~know what it means to work on draft ideas and complete them into a product. I~have experience involving customers into the design process, working in their constrained environments, and adapting to their needs and requirements.

I~hope my profile fits your requirements, sincerely yours,
